Programmable Lua processors for RimWorld.

# Hello!
This is very much a work in progress. There is in-game documentation, but it is incomplete. You can view the functions you can use in-game in the "Terminal" folder at the source folder.

This mod uses NLua, a .NET Lua interpreter. 3 and a half cheers to them for making this mod possible!
